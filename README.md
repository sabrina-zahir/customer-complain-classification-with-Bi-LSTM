# customer complain classification with Bi-LSTM

**Introduction**
-----------------------------
The dataframe consists of 162421 complaints for 5 products. The dataframe is considerably imbalanced.

The notebook implements Bi-LSTM model for multiclass classification of product complaints. Based on the provided complaints, the goal of the notebook is to accurately identify the product.
